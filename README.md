# StockTransaction

This project was completed for Data Structures 1 taken at Marquette University 2017. The goal of the project was to demonstrate understand of how to use double-link unbounded queues. In the project students had to interface with a user and worry about destroying data as they searched the queues; as well as read information in from supplied text files.
